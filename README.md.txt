Sure, let's organize the questions by topic:

### Inheritance:
1. Define a class `Animal` with a method `sound()`. Create a subclass `Dog` that inherits from `Animal` and overrides the `sound()` method to return "Woof".
2. Create a class hierarchy for different types of vehicles. Include a base class `Vehicle` and subclasses such as `Car`, `Motorcycle`, and `Truck`. Ensure that each subclass has appropriate attributes and methods.
3. Create a class `Employee` with attributes `name` and `salary`. Create subclasses `Manager` and `Developer`. Managers have an additional attribute `department`, while Developers have `programming_language`. Implement appropriate methods for each subclass.
4. Design a class hierarchy for different types of electronic devices. Include a base class `Device` and subclasses such as `Phone`, `Laptop`, and `Tablet`. Ensure that each subclass has specific attributes and methods.
5. Create a class `Animal` with a method `sound()`. Create subclasses `Cat`, `Cow`, and `Horse`. Each subclass should override the `sound()` method to return the respective animal sound.
6. Define a class Shape with a method area(). Create subclasses Rectangle and Triangle. Override the area() method in each subclass to calculate the area of a rectangle and triangle respectively.
7. Design a class hierarchy for different types of employees in a company. Include a base class Employee and subclasses such as Manager, Engineer, and Salesperson. Each subclass should have attributes specific to their role and appropriate methods.
8. Create a class Vehicle with attributes make and model. Create subclasses Car and Bike that inherit from Vehicle and have additional attributes like num_doors for cars and num_gears for bikes.
9. Implement a class hierarchy for different types of shapes. Include a base class Shape and subclasses such as Rectangle, Circle, and Triangle. Each subclass should have methods to calculate its area and perimeter.
10. Define a class Person with attributes name and age. Create subclasses Teacher and Student. Teachers have an additional attribute subject, while students have grade. Implement appropriate methods for each subclass.

### Encapsulation:
1. Create a class `Student` with private attributes `__name` and `__age`. Provide public methods to set and get these attributes.
2. Implement a class `BankAccount` with private attributes `__balance`. Provide public methods to deposit, withdraw, and check balance, ensuring that withdrawals cannot exceed the balance.
3. Create a class `Person` with private attributes `__name`, `__age`, and `__gender`. Provide public methods to set and get these attributes.
4. Implement a class `House` with private attributes `__address`, `__num_rooms`, and `__price`. Provide public methods to set and get these attributes, ensuring that the price cannot be negative.

### Polymorphism:
1. Define a class `Shape` with a method `area()`. Create subclasses `Rectangle` and `Circle` that override the `area()` method to calculate the area of a rectangle and circle respectively.
2. Create a function `total_area(shapes)` that takes a list of shapes (objects of classes derived from `Shape`) and returns the total area of all shapes.
3. Define a class `Animal` with a method `sound()`. Create subclasses `Cat`, `Cow`, and `Horse`. Each subclass should override the `sound()` method to return the respective animal sound.
4. Create a function `calculate_area(shape)` that takes an object of a class derived from `Shape` (e.g., `Rectangle` or `Circle`) and returns the area of the shape.

### Numpy and Basic Python:
1. Create a numpy array with values from 1 to 10.
2. Perform element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numpy arrays of the same shape.
3. Write a Python function to find the factorial of a number using recursion.
4. Write a Python function to check if a given number is prime.
5. Create a numpy array with random values of shape (3, 3).
6. Perform matrix multiplication on two numpy arrays of appropriate shapes.
7. Write a Python function to check if a given string is a palindrome.
8. Write a Python function to find the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
