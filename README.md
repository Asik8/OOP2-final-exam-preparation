### Polymorphism:
1. Define a class `Shape` with a method `area()`. Create subclasses `Rectangle` and `Circle` that override the `area()` method to calculate the area of a rectangle and circle respectively.

2. Create a function `total_area(shapes)` that takes a list of shapes (objects of classes derived from `Shape`) and returns the total area of all shapes.

3. Define a class `Animal` with a method `sound()`. Create subclasses `Cat`, `Cow`, and `Horse`. Each subclass should override the `sound()` method to return the respective animal sound.

4. Create a function `calculate_area(shape)` that takes an object of a class derived from `Shape` (e.g., `Rectangle` or `Circle`) and returns the area of the shape.

5. Define a class Animal with a method sound(). Create subclasses Bird, Dog, and Cat. Each subclass should override the sound() method to return the respective animal sound.

6. Create a function calculate_volume(shape) that takes an object of a class derived from Shape (e.g., Cube or Cylinder) and returns the volume of the shape.
