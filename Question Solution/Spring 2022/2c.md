Explanation of Using NumPy Arrays
NumPy arrays are used instead of lists because they offer significant advantages:

Performance: NumPy arrays are optimized for numerical computations and provide faster execution compared to Python lists. Operations on NumPy arrays are implemented in C and use contiguous memory blocks, which improves speed and efficiency.

Functionality: NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical and statistical functions that are not available for Python lists. This makes NumPy arrays more powerful and suitable for scientific computing.

Convenience: NumPy allows for element-wise operations and broadcasting, which makes it easier to perform complex calculations with less code. Additionally, reshaping and manipulating arrays is more straightforward with NumPy.
